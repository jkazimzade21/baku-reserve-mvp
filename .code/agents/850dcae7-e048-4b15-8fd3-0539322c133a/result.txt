## Summary

As the **Adversarial/Edge Explorer** for this forensic audit, I've completed my analysis focusing on edge cases, race conditions, and failure scenarios. The system has critical issues that would prevent it from running reliably in production:

**Most Critical Findings:**
- File-based storage with flawed locking that enables race conditions and data corruption
- No timezone/DST handling causing booking misalignment during transitions  
- Missing idempotency controls allowing duplicate reservations
- Mobile app has zero network resilience, losing data on any connection interruption
- Global circuit breaker creates unnecessary failure cascades

The codebase needs significant hardening before it could handle even moderate concurrent load. The file-based persistence is fundamentally unsuitable for production and should be replaced with a proper database with ACID guarantees.
